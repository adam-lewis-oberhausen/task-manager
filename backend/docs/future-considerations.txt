A few additional improvements we could make when loading the TaskList.

 1 Add loading indicators between steps
 2 Implement caching for workspace/project data
 3 Add retry logic for failed requests
 4 Add more detailed error messages
 5 Implement proper TypeScript types

Additional Recommendations for code in TaskList.js

 1 Consider creating custom hooks for:
    • Task panel state management
    • Task editing logic
    • Data fetching
 2 Extract complex JSX into separate components:
    • TaskTable component
    • TaskPanel component
    • TaskControls component
 3 Use TypeScript for better type safety
